# empiricalgalo: Empirical models of the galaxy-halo connection

Collection of empirical models of the galaxy-halo connection. Primarily in based in Python and Julia. If you use any of the code implemented in this repository please consider citing [1].

## Models
1. Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) based on Yao-Yuan Mao's [implementation](https://github.com/yymao/abundancematching) with Peter Behroozi's fiducial deconvolution implementation based on the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. Assumes a constant (log)-normal scatter in the galaxy proxy conditioned on the halo proxy.




## TO-DO
- [ ] Add minimal working examples.
